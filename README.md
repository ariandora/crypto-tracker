### New in v0.0.7:
* Changed the shade of green after multiple reports from people who couldn't read the value because of the contrast.
* Fixed an issue where if the price change was double digits it will display on 2 lines inside the popup.
* Fixed a bug where the currency would revert itself to USD after you've chosen another currency.

### Roadmap:
- v0.0.8 - Desktop alerts when the price hits a certain threshold
